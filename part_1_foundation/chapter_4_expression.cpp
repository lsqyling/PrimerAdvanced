 * Exercise 4.3:

/*
 * Exercise 4.31:
 * The program in this section used the prefix increment and decrement operators.
 * Explain why we used prefix and not postfix. What changes would have to be made to use the postfix versions?
 * Rewrite the program using postfix operators.
 * postfix will copy itself as return, then increment or decrement. prefix will increment or decrement first,
 * and return itself. so prefix is more effective in this program.(reduce one copy space.)
 * We use prefix and not postfix, just because of the Advice: Use Postfix Operators only When Necessary on Â§4.5.
 * Increment and Decrement Operators.
 * Advice: Use Postfix Operators only When Necessary
 * Readers from a C background might be surprised that we use the prefix increment in the programs we've written.
 * The reason is simple: The prefix version avoids unnecessary work. It increments the value and returns the incremented version.
 * The postfix operator must store the original value so that it can return the unincremented value as its result.
 * If we donâ€™t need the unincremented value, thereâ€™s no need for the extra work done by the postfix operator.
 * For ints and pointers, the compiler can optimize away this extra work. For more complicated iterator types,
 * this extra work potentially might be more costly. By habitually using the prefix versions,
 * we do not have to worry about whether the performance difference matters.
 * Moreoverâ€”and perhaps more importantlyâ€”we can express the intent of our programs more directly.
 * So, it's just a good habits. And there are no changes if we have to be made to use the postfix versions.
 * Rewrite:
 * for(vector<int>::size_type ix = 0; ix != ivec.size(); ix++, cnt--)
 * ivec[ix] = cnt;
 * This is not an appropriate example to discuss the difference of prefix and postfix.

 * (someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x), --y
